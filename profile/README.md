## Why we exist

Because a website must sell, a transaction must clear, a network must hold, and AI must **actually** help.  
NerionSoft starts from a simple idea: fuse **design, engineering, and ops** to ship products that solve concrete problems—without noise or empty jargon.

---

## What you get (without a never-ending list)

A **website** that loads fast, ranks well, and tells your value proposition clearly.  
A **transactional flow** that won’t flinch on launch day: carts, payments, vouchers, tax, and accounting exports—frictionless for customers, auditable for back-office.  
A **network** that matches reality: clean VLANs, a polished captive portal, observability, and backups that **work** when needed.  
**AI** that serves the business: classification, extraction, recommendations—models chosen for impact, not hype.

---

## How we work

We begin by **understanding your constraints**: timeline, processes, team, budget.  
We **design the experience** before writing a single line.  
We **build in modules**: a solid base (infra as code, CI/CD), then switchable capabilities—booking, payments, CRM, analytics.  
We **operate** with readable metrics: availability, latency, success rates, conversions.  
And we **handover properly**: short docs, clear access, and an ops runbook.

---

## Our raw materials

Frontend speaks **Next.js** to the browser.  
APIs think in **TypeScript/Node** (or **Python** when data gets heavier).  
Truth lives in **PostgreSQL** (and befriends **Redis** for speed).  
Containers travel with **Docker**, orchestrated by **Kubernetes**.  
Everything is observable: **logs, metrics, traces**. And backed up—encrypted.

---

## Security, by design

Encryption in transit and at rest, managed secrets, least privilege, access logs.  
No vague promises: **concrete controls** (scans, reviews, restore tests) and written responsibilities.  
Trust isn’t declared—it’s **measured**.

---

## Snapshots from the field

- A hotel sells **gift cards** and handles **pre-bookings** without friction; staff export to accounting in two clicks.  
- An SME connects its **site** to its **ERP**, tracks conversions, and tunes campaigns with reliable numbers.  
- A Wi-Fi network **welcomes** guests with a clean captive portal, isolates traffic, and stays readable for IT.  
- A **sober** back-office centralizes data; an AI classifies, summarizes, and **accelerates** the day-to-day.
