# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in NerionSoft
projects and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community (e.g.,
using an official NerionSoft email address, posting via official accounts,
or acting as a representative at events).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team responsible for enforcement at
**contact@nerionsoft.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the
privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining consequences for conduct they deem in violation of this Code of
Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior
deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning  
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
Interactions with the people involved (including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct) may be restricted for a specified
period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban  
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from all community interactions and
communications for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a
permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban  
**Community Impact:** A pattern of repeated violations or a violation so
serious that community safety cannot be ensured with continued membership.  
**Consequence:** A permanent ban from NerionSoft community spaces.
